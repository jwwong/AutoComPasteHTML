What is dynamic ?
Relating to conditions that are changing or in motion.

What is E-core ?
Laminated form in the shape of the letter "E", onto which inductors and transformers are wound.

What is eddy currents ?
Currents induced into a conducting core due to the changing magnetic field. Eddy currents produce heat which is a loss of power and lowers the efficiency of an inductor.

What is efficiency ?
The amount of power delivered to the load of an amplifier as a percentage of the power required from the power supply.

What is electric charge ?
Electric energy stored on the surface of a material. Also known as a static charge.

What is electric field ?
A field or force that exists in the space  between two different potentials or voltages. Also known as an electrostatic field.

What is electricity ?
Science states that certain particles possess a force field or charge. The charge possessed by an electron is negative while the charge possessed by a proton is positive. Electricity can be divided into two groups, static and dynamic. Static electricity deals with charges at rest and dynamic electricity deals with charges in motion.
