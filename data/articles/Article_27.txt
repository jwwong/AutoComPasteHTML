What is junction ?
Contact or connection between two or more wires or cables. The area where the p-type material and n-type material meet in a semiconductor.

What is junction diode ?
diode. A semiconductor diode in which the rectifying characteristics occur at a junction between the n-type and p-type semiconductor materials.

What is kilowatt-hour meter ?
A meter used by electric utility companies to measure the amount of electric power used by a customer.

What is kinetic energy ?
Energy associated with motion.

What is Kirchhoff"s voltage law ?
The algebraic sum of the voltage drops in a closed path circuit is equal to the algebraic sum of the source voltages applied.

What is knee voltage ?
The voltage at which a curve joins two relatively straight portions of a characteristic curve. For a PN junction diode, the point in the forward operating region of the characteristic curve where conduction starts to increase rapidly. For a zener diode, the term is often used in reference to the zener voltage rating.
