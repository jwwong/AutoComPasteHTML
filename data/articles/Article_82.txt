What is voltage divider biasing ?
Biasing method used with amplifiers in which two series resistors connected across a source. The junction of the two biasing resistors provides correct bias voltage for the amplifier.

What is voltage drop ?
Voltage or difference in potential developed across a component due to current flow.

What is voltage feedback ?
Feedback configuration where a portion of the output voltage is fed back to the input of an amplifier.

What is voltage follower ?
Operational amplifier circuit characterized by a high input impedance, low output impedance and unity voltage gain. Used as a buffer between a source and a low impedance load.

What is voltage gain ?
Also called voltage amplification. Ratio of amplifier output voltage to input voltage usually expressed in decibels.

What is voltage multiplier ?
Rectifier circuit using diodes and capacitors to produce a DC output voltage that is some multiple of the peak value of AC input voltage. Cost effective way of producing higher DC voltages. Voltage doublers and voltage triples are examples.
