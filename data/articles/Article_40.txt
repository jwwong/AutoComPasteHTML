What is open loop gain ?
Gain of an amplifier when no feedback is present.

What is open loop mode ?
An amplifier circuit having no means of comparing the output with the input.  (No feedback).

What is operational amplifier ?
A high gain DC amplifier that has a high input impedance and a low output impedance. Op-amps are the most basic type of linear integrated circuits.

What is oscillate ?
To produce a continuous output waveform without an input signal present.

What is oscilloscope ?
An instrument used to display a signal graphically. Shows signal amplitude, period and waveshape in addition to any DC voltage present. A multiple trace oscilloscope can show two or more waveforms at the same time for phase comparison and timing measurements.
