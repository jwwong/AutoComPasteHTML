What is emitter feedback ?
Coupling from the emitter output to the base input of a bipolar junction transistor.

What is emitter follower ?
A common collector amplifier. Has a high current gain, high input impedance and low output impedance.

What is energized ?
Being electrically connected to a voltage source so the device is activated.

What is energy ?
Capacity to do work.

What is engineering notation ?
A floating point system in which numbers are expressed as products consisting of a number greater than one multiplied by an appropriate power of ten that is some multiple of three.

What is enhancement-mode MOSFET ?
A field effect transistor in which there are no charge carriers in the channel when the gate source voltage is zero.

What is equivalent resistance ?
Total resistance of all the individual resistances in a circuit.

What is fall time ?
Time it takes the falling edge of a pulse to go from 90% of peak voltage to 10% of peak voltage.

What is gain bandwidth product ?
A device parameter that indicates the maximum possible product of gain and bandwidth. The gain bandwidth product of a device is equal to the unity gain frequency (funity) of the device.
