What is choke ?
Inductor used to oppose the flow of alternating current.

What is circuit ?
Interconnection of components to provide an electrical path between two or more components.

What is circuit breaker ?
A protective device used to open a circuit when current exceeds a maximum value. In effect a reusable fuse.

What is clamper ?
A diode circuit used to change the DC level of a waveform without distorting the waveform.

What is clapp oscillator ?
A variation of the Colpitts oscillator. An added capacitor is used to eliminate the effects of stray capacitance on the operation of the basic Colpitts oscillator.

What is class A amplifier ?
A linear amplifier biased so the active device conducts through 360 degrees of the input waveform.

What is class B amplifier ?
An amplifier with two active devices. The active components are biased so that each conducts for approximately 180 degrees of the input waveform cycle.
