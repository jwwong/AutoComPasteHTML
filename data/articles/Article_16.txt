What is DC power supply ?
Any source of DC power for electrical equipment.

What is dead short ?
Short circuit having zero resistance.

What is decade ?
A frequency factor of ten.

What is decibel ?
(dB) a logarithmic representation of gain or loss.

What is degenerative feedback ?
Also called negative feedback. A portion of the output of an amplifier is inverted and connected back to the input. This controls the gain of the amplifier and reduces distortion and noise.

What is delay time ?
The time for collector current to reach 10% of its maximum value in a BJT switching circuit.

What is depletion region ?
There area surrounding a pn junction that is depleted of carriers.

What is depletion mode ?
In a FET, an operating mode where reverse gate-source voltage is used to deplete the channel of free carriers. This reduces the size of the channel and increases its resistance.
