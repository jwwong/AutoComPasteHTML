What is regulator ?
Device or circuit that maintains a desired output under changing conditions.

What is relay ?
Electromechanical device that opens or closes contacts when a current is passed through a coil.

What is relative ?
Not independent. Compared with or with respect to some other measured quantity.

What is relaxation oscillator ?
Free running circuit that outputs pulses with a period dependent or one or more RC time constants.

What is reluctance ?
Resistance to the flow of magnetic lines of force.

What is remanence ?
Amount a material remains magnetized after the magnetizing force has been removed.

What is residual magnetism ?
Magnetism remaining in the core of an electromagnet after the coil current is removed.

What is resistance ?
Symbolized "R" and measured in ohms. Opposition to current flow and dissipation of energy in the form of heat.
