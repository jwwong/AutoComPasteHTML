What is left-hand-rule ?
If fingers of the left hand are placed around a wire so that the thumb points in the direction of electron flow, the fingers will be pointing in the direction of the magnetic field being produced by the conductor.

What is Lenz's law ?
The current induced in a circuit due to a change in the magnetic field is so directed as to oppose the flux, or to exert a mechanical force to oppose the motion.

What is level detector ?
An op-amp circuit that compares two inputs and provides a DC output indicating the polarity relationship between the inputs. A comparator.
