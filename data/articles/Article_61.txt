What is signal to noise ratio ?
Ratio of the magnitude of the signal to the magnitude of noise usually expressed in decibels.

What is silicon ?
(Si) Non metallic element (atomic number 14) used in pure form as a semiconductor.

What is silicon-controlled rectifier ?
(SCR) Three terminal active device that acts as a gated diode. The gate terminal is used to turn the device on allowing current to pass from cathode to anode.

What is silicon controlled switch ?
An SCR with an added terminal called an anode gate. A positive pulse either at the anode gate or the cathode gate will turn the device on.

What is silicon dioxide ?
Glass like material used as the gate insulating material in a MOSFET.
