What is color code ?
Set of colors used to indicate value of a component.

What is colpitts oscillator ?
An oscillator with a pair of tapped capacitors in the feedback network.

What is common base amplifier ?
A BJT circuit in which the base connection is common to both input and output.

What is common drain amplifier ?
A FET circuit in which the drain connection is common to both input and output.

What is common-mode signals ?
Signals that appear simultaneously at two inputs of an operational amplifier. Common mode signals are always equal in amplitude and phase.

What is comparitor ?
An op-amp circuit that compares two inputs and provides a DC output indicating the polarity relationship between the inputs.

What is complementry transistors ?
Two transistors, one NPN and one PNP having near identical characteristics. N-channel and P-channel FETs can also be complementary.

What is complex numbers ?
Numbers composed of a real number part and an imaginary number part.
