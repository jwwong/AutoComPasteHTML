What is series circuit ?
Circuit in which the components are connected end to end so that current has only one path to follow through the circuit.

What is series parallel network ?
Network that contains components connected in both series and parallel.

What is series resonance ?
Condition that occurs in a series LC circuit at the frequency where inductive reactance equals capacitive reactance. Impedance is minimum, current is maximum limited only by resistance in the circuit.

What is seven segment display ?
Device made of several light emitting diodes arranged in a numeric or alphanumeric pattern. By lighting selected segments numeric or alphabet characters can be displayed.

What is shells or bands ?
Orbital path containing a group of electrons having a common energy level.

What is shield ?
Metal grounded cover used to protect a wire, component or piece of equipment from stray magnetic and/or electric fields.

What is short circuit ?
Also called a short. Low resistance connection between two points in a circuit typically causing excessive current.
