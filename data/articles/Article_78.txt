What is turn-off time ?
Sum of storage time and fall time.

What is turns ratio ?
Ratio of the number of turns in the secondary winding of a transformer to the number of turns in the primary winding. Two repeating waveforms having a phase difference of 90.

What is ultrasonic ?
Signals that are just above the frequency range of human hearing of approximately 20 kHz.

What is uncharged ?
Material having atoms with the same number of electrons in orbit as the number of protons in the nucleus. Having no electrical charge.

What is unijunction transistor ?
Three terminal device that acts as a diode with its own internal voltage divider biasing circuit.

What is unity gain frequency ?
Frequency of operation for a device where the gain of the component drops to unity.

What is vacuum tube ?
Electron tube evacuated to such a degree that its electrical characteristics are essentially unaffected by the presence of residual gas or vapor. Have been essentially replaced by transistors for amplification and rectification. Cathode ray tubes are still used as display devices.
