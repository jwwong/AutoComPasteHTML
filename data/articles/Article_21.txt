What is electric polarization ?
A displacement of bound charges in a dielectric when placed in an electric field.

What is electroacoustic transducer ?
Device that produces an energy transfer from electric to acoustic (sound) or from acoustic to electric. Examples include a microphone, earphones and loudspeakers.

What is electroluminescence ?
Conversion of electrical energy into light energy.

What is electrolyte ?
Electrically conducting liquid (wet) or paste (dry)

What is electrolytic capacitor ?
A capacitor having an electrolyte between the two plates. A thin layer of oxide is deposited on only the positive plate. The oxide acts as the dielectric for the capacitor. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized and so must be connected in correct polarity to prevent breakdown.
