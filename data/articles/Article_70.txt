What is sweep generator ?
Test instrument designed to produce a voltage that continuously varies in frequency over a band of frequencies. Used as a source to display frequency response of a circuit on an oscilloscope.

What is switch ?
Electrical device having two states, on (closed) or off (open).  Ideally having zero impedance when closed and infinite impedance when open.

What is switching transistor ?
Transistor designed to change rapidly between saturation and cut-off.

What is synchronization ?
Also called sync. Precise matching of two waves or functions.

What is synchronous ?

What is sync pulse ?
Pulse used as a reference for synchronization.

What is system ?
