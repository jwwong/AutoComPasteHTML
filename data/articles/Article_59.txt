What is secondary ?
Output winding of a transformer. Winding that is connected to a load.

What is secondary cell ?
Electrolytic cell used to store electricity. Once discharged may be restored by recharging by putting current through the cell in the direction opposite to that of discharge current.

What is selectivity ?
Charistic of a circuit to discriminate between wanted and unwanted signals.

What is self biasing ?
Gate bias for a field effect transistor in which source current through a resistor produces the voltage for gate to source bias.

What is self inductance ?
Property that causes a counter electro motive force to be produced in a conductor when the magnetic field expands or collapses with a change of current.

What is semiconductor ?
An element which is neither a good conductor or a good insulator, but rather lies somewhere between the two. Characterized by a valence shell containing four electrons. Silicon, germanium and carbon are the semiconductors most frequently used in electronics.
