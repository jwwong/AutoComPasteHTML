What is RC time constant ?
Product of resistance and capacitance in seconds.

What is reactance ?
Symbol "X". Opposition to current flow without the dissipation of energy. Example: The opposition provided by inductance or capacitance to AC current.

What is reactive power ?
Also called imaginary power or wattless power. It is the power value in "volt amps" obtained from the product of source voltage and source current in a reactive circuit.

What is real number ?
Number having no imaginary part.

What is receiver ?
Unit or piece of equipment used to receive information.

What is recombination ?
Process by which a conduction band electron gives up energy (in the form of heat or light) and falls into a valence band hole.

What is rectangular coordinates ?
A Cartesian coordinate of a Cartesian coordinate system whose straight-line axes or coordinate planes are perpendicular.
