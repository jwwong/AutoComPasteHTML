What is superheterodyne receiver ?
Radio receiver that converts all radio frequencies to a fixed intermediate frequency to maximize gain and bandwidth before demodulation.

What is super high frequency ?
(SHF) Frequency band between 3 GHz and 30 GHz. So desiganted by Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

What is superposition theorem ?
Theorem designed to simplify networks containing two or more sources. It states that in a network containing more than one source, the current at any one point is equal to the algebraic sum of the currents produced by each source acting separately.

What is supply voltage ?
Voltage provided by a power source.

What is surface-barrier diode ?
(Schottky diode)High speed diode that has very little junction capacitance. Also known as a "hot-carrier diode".

What is surface leakage current ?
Diode reverse current that passes along the surface of the semiconductor materials.

What is surge current ?
High charging current that flows into a power supply filter capacitor as the power is first turned on.
