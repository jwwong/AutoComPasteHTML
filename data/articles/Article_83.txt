What is voltage rating ?
Maximum voltage a component can withstand without breaking down.

What is voltage regulator ?
Device or circuit that maintains constant output voltage (within certain limits) in spite of changing line voltage and/or load current.

What is voltage source ?
Circuit or device that supplies voltage to a load.

What is voltaic cell ?
Primary cell having two unlike electrodes immersed in a solution that chemically interacts to produce a voltage.

What is volt-ampere ?
Unit of apparent power in an AC circuit containing capacitive or inductive reactance. Apparent power is the product of source voltage and current.

What is voltmeter ?
Instrument used to measure difference in potential between two points.

What is volume ?
Magnitude or power level of audio frequency. Measured in volume units (VU).
