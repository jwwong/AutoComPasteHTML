What is bleeder current ?
A current drawn continuously from a source. Bleeder current is used to stabilize the output voltage of a source.

What is bode plot ?
A graph of gain versus frequency.

What is branch current ?
The portion of total current flowing in one path of a parallel circuit.

What is breakdown voltage ?
Voltage at which the breakdown of a dialectric or insulator occurs.

What is breakover voltage ?
Minimum voltage required to cause a diac to break down and conduct.

What is bridge rectifier ?
A circuit using four diodes to provide full wave rectification. Converts an AC voltage to a pulsating DC voltage.

What is buffer ?
An amplifier used to isolate a load from a source.

What is bulk resistance ?
The natural resistance of a "P" type or "N" type semiconductor material.
