What is negative ion ?
An atom having a greater number of electrons in orbit than there are protons in the nucleus.

What is negative resistance ?
A resistance such that when the current through it increases the voltage drop across the resistance decreases.

What is negative temperature coefficient ?
A term used to describe a component whose resistance or capacitance decreases when temperature increases.

What is neon bulb ?
Glass envelope filled with neon gas which when ionized by an applied voltage will glow red.

What is network ?
Combination of interconnected components, circuits or systems.

What is neutral ?
A terminal, point or object with balanced charges. Neither positive or negative.

What is neutral atom ?
An atom in which the number of negative charges (electrons in orbit) is equal to the number of positive charges (protons in the nucleus).

What is neutral wire ?
The conductor of a polyphase circuit or a single-phase three wire circuit that is intended to have a ground potential. The potential difference between the neutral and each of the other conductors are approximately equal in magnitude and equally spaced in phase.
