What is magnetism ?
Property of some materials to attract or repel others.

What is magnetizing force ?
Also called  magnetic field strength. It is the magnetomotive force per unit length at any given point in a magnetic circuit.

What is magnetomotive force ?
Force that produces a magnetic field.

What is majority carriers ?
The conduction band electrons in an n-type material and the valence band holes in a p-type material. Produced by pentavalent impurities in n-type material and trivalent impurities in p-type material.

What is matched impedance ?
Condition that occurs when the output impedance of a source is equal to the input impedance of a load.

What is matching ?
Connection of two components or circuits so that maximum power is transferred between the two.

What is maximum power transfer ?
A theorem that states that maximum power will be transferred from source to load when input impedance of the load equals the output impedance of the source.

What is Maxwell ?
Unit of magnetic flux. One maxwell equals one magnetic line of force.
