What is soldering iron ?
Tool with an internal heating element used to heat surfaces being soldered to the point where the solder becomes molten.

What is solenoid ?
An air core coil. Equipped with a movable iron core the solenoid will produce motion. As a result of current through the coil the iron core is pulled into the center of the winding. When the coil is deenergized, a spring pulls the movable core away from the center of the winding. Mechanical devices connected to the movable core are made to move as a result of current through the coil. Example: Electric door locks on some automobiles.

What is solid conductor ?
Conductor having a single solid wire instead of strands of fine wire twisted together.

What is solid state ?
