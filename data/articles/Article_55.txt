What is resistive power ?
Amount of power dissipated as heat in a circuit containing resistive and reactive components. True power as opposed to reactive power.

What is resistive temperature detector ?
(RTD)  Temperature detector consisting of a fine coil of conducting wire (such as platinum) that will produce a relatively linear increase in resistance as temperature increases.

What is resistivity ?
Measure of a material's resistance to current flow.

What is resistor ?
Component made of material that opposes flow of current and therefore has some value of resistance.

What is resistor color code ?
Coding system of colored stripes on a resistor to indicate the resistor's value and tolerance.

What is resonance ?
Circuit condition that occurs at the frequency where inductive reactance (XL) equals capacitive reactance (XC).

What is reverse bias ?
Bias on a PN junction that allows only leakage current (minority carriers) to flow. Positive polarity on the n-type material and negative polarity to the p-type material.

What is reverse breakdown voltage ?
Amount of reverse bias that will cause a PN junction to break down and conduct in the reverse direction.
