What is mutual inductance ?
Ability of one inductor's lines of force to link with another inductor

What is n-type semiconductor ?
A semiconductor compound formed by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with a pentavalent element. An n-type material contains an excess of conduction band electrons.

What is negative ?
Terminal that has an excess of electrons.

What is negative charge ?
A charge that has more electrons than protons

What is negative feedback ?
A feedback signal 180?out of phase with an amplifier input signal. Used to increase amplifier stability, bandwidth and input impedance. Also reduces distortion.
