What is TO package ?

What is transconductance ?
Also called mutual conductance. Ratio of a change in output current to the change in input voltage that caused it.

What is transducer ?
Device that converts energy from one form to another.

What is transformer ?
Inductor with two or more windings. Through mutual inductance, current in one winding called a primary will induce current into the other windings called secondary's.
