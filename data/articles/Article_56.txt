What is reverse current ?
Current through a diode when reverse biased. An extremely small current also referred to as leakage.

What is reverse saturation current ?
Reverse current through a diode caused by thermal activity. This current is not affected by the amount of reverse bias on the component, but does vary with temperature.

What is rheostat ?
Two terminal variable resistor used to control current.

What is right angle triangle ?
Triangle having a 90 degrees or square corner.

What is ripple frequency ?
Frequency of the ripple present in the output of a DC source.

What is ripple voltage ?
The small variations in Dc voltage that remain after filtering in a power supply.

What is rise time ?
Time for the leading edge of a pulse to rise from 10% of its peak value to 90% of its peak value.

What is RL differentiator ?
An RL circuit whose output voltage is proportional to the rate of change of the input voltage.
