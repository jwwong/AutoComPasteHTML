What is thermal stability ?
The ability of a circuit to maintain stable characteristics in spite of increased temperature.

What is thermistor ?
Temperature sensitive semiconductor that has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance. As temperature increases, resistance decreases.

What is thermometry ?
Relating to the measuring of temperature.

What is thermostat ?
Device that opens or closes a circuit in response to changes in temperature.

What is Thevenin's theorem ?
Theorem that replaces any complex network with a single voltage source in series with a single resistance.

What is thick-film capacitor ?
Capacitor consisting of two thick-film layers of conductive film separated by a deposited thick-layer dialectric film.

What is thick film resistor ?
Fixed value resistor consisting of thick-film resistive element made from metal particles and glass powder.

What is thin film capacitor ?
Capacitor in which both the electrodes and the dialectric are deposited in layers on a substrate.
