What is stereo sound ?
System in which reproduced sound is delivered through two or more channels to give a sense of direction to the source.

What is stop band ?
Range of frequencies outside the pass band of a tuned amplifier.

What is storage time ?
In a BJT switching circuit, it is the time required for collector current to drop from 100% to 90% of its maximum value.

What is stranded conductor ?
Conductor composed of a group of strands of wire twisted together.

What is stray capacitance ?
Undesirable capacitance that exists between two conductors such as two leads or one lead and a metal chassis.

What is subassembly ?
Components contained in a unit for convenience in assembling or servicing equipment.

What is subatomic ?
Particles such as electrons, protons and neutrons that are smaller than atoms.

What is substrate ?
Mechanical insulating support upon which a device is fabricated.

What is summing amplifier ?
An op-amp circuit whose output is proportional to the sum of its instantaneous voltages.

What is superconductor ?
Metal such as lead or niobium that, when cooled to within a few degrees of absolute zero, can conduct current with no resistance.
