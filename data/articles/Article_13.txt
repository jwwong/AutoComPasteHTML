What is compliance ?
The maximum possible peak-to-peak output of an amplifier.

What is constant current circuit ?
Circuit used to maintain constant current to a load having resistance that changes.

What is contact ?
Current carrying part of a switch, relay or connector.

What is continuity ?
Occurs when a complete path for current exists.

What is conventional current flow ?
Concept of current produced by the movement of positive charges towards the negative terminal of a source.

What is copper loss ?
Power lost in transformers, generators, connecting wires and other parts of a circuit due to current flow through the resistance of copper conductors.

What is coulomb ?
Unit of electric charge. A negative coulomb charge consists of 6.24 x 1018 electrons.

What is counter electromotive force ?
(counter emf) Voltage induced into an inductor due to an alternating or pulsating current. Counter emf is always in polarity opposite to that of the applied voltage. Opposing a change of current.
