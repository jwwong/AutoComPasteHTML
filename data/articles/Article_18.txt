What is diode ?

What is direct coupling ?
Where the output of an amplifier is connected directly to the input of another amplifier or to a load. Also known as DC coupling because DC signals are not blocked.

What is direct current ?
Current that flows in only one direction.

What is discharge ?
Release of energy stored in either a battery or a capacitor.

What is discrete component ?
Package containing only a single component as opposed to an integrated circuit containing many components in a single package.

What is dissipation ?
Release of electrical energy in the form of heat.

What is distortion ?
An undesired change in a waveform or signal.

What is distributed capacitance ?
Any capacitance other than that within a capacitor. For example, the capacitance between adjacent turns of wire in a coil.
