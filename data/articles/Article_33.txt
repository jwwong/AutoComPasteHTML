What is microphone ?
Electroacoustic transducer that converts sound energy into electric energy.

What is microwave ?
Band of very short wavelength radio waves within the UHF, SHF and EHF bands.

What is midband gain ?
Gain of an amplifier operating within its bandwidth.

What is mid-point bias ?
An amplifier biased at the center of its DC load line.

What is Miller's theorem ?
A theorem that allows you to represent a feedback capacitor as equivalent input and output shunt capacitors.

What is minority carriers ?
The conduction band holes in n-type material and valence band electrons in p-type material. Most minority carriers are produced by temperature rather than by doping with impurities.

What is mismatch ?
Term used to describe a difference between the output impedance of a source and the input impedance of a load. A mismatch prevents the maximum transfer of power from source to load.

What is modulation ?
Process by which an information signal (audio for example) is used to modify some characteristic of a higher frequency wave known as a carrier (radio for example).
