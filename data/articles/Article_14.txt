What is coupling ?
To electronically connect two circuits so that signal will pass from one to the other.

What is covalent bond ?
The way some atoms complete their valence shells by sharing valence electrons with neighbouring atoms.

What is crossover distortion ?
Distortion caused by both devices in a class B amplifier being cut-off at the same time.

What is crowbar ?
Circuit used to protect the output of a source from a short circuited load. Load current is limited to a value the source can deliver without damage.

What is crystal ?
Natural or synthetic piezoelectric or semiconductor material with atoms arranged with some degree of geometric regularity.

What is crystal-controlled oscillator ?
Oscillator that uses a quartz crystal in its feedback path to maintain a stable output frequency.

What is current ?
Measured in amperes, it is the flow of electrons through a conductor. Also know as electron flow.
