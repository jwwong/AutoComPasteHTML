What is permanence ?
Magnetic equivalent of magnetic inductance and consequently equal to the reciprocal of reluctance, just as conductance is equal to the reciprocal of resistance.

What is permanent magnet ?
Magnet normally made of hardened steel that retains its magnetism indefinitely.

What is permeability ?
Measure of how much better a material is as a path for magnetic lines of forcewith respect to air which has a permeability of one. Symbolized by the Greek lower case letter mu (m).

What is phase ?
Angular relationship between two waves.

What is phase angle ?
Phase difference between two or more waves,normally expressed in degrees.

What is phase shift ?
Change in phase of a wave form between two points, expressed as degrees of lead or lag.

What is phase shift oscillator ?
An oscillator that uses three RC networks inits feedback path to produce the 180 degrees phase shift required for oscillation.

What is phase splitter ?
Circuit that takes a single input signal and produces two output signals that are 180 degrees apart in phase.

What is phonograph ?
Piece of equipment used to reproduce sound stored on a disk called a phonograph record.
