#How to Install:
You should have your own local server to run this. You can get and install a local server like XAMPP or MAMP
- for Windows: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html
- and Linux: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html
- for Mac: http://www.mamp.info/

and then put this at ```htdocs```. Preferably put it in a folder.    
For this purpose, the name of the folder will be: ```acptest```

#Accessing:
To access the ACP Testing Environment, just type:   
For Windows and Linux: ```localhost/acptest```      
For Mac: ```localhost:8888/acptest```   

Note: because MAMP usually puts it in a different port -> 8888, check MAMP settings on what port to access the MAMP server
